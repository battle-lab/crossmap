# Cross-mappability

Cross-mappability from gene A to gene B, crossmap(A,B), is defined as the number of gene A's k-mers (75-mers from exons and 36-mers from UTRs) whose alignment start within exonic or untranslated regions of gene B. Cross-mappability has been described in the following paper.

### How to compute cross-mappability
* These check pre-requisites before computing cross-mappabilities from the [prerequisites page](https://github.com/battle-lab/crossmap/blob/master/prerequisites.md).
* Compute cross-mappabilites genome-wide following instructions step by step from [this page](https://github.com/battle-lab/crossmap/blob/master/compute_crossmap.md).

### Download pre-computed cross-mappability
