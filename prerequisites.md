### Inpute requirements
The following items are required to compute cross-mappability genomewide.
- The genome sequences (one fasta file for each chromosome)
- Gene annotation file (Format: GTF)
- Mappability of each k-mer (Format: bed or bigWig)
- Bowtie index for the genome

### Program requirements
- R
- bowtie v1

#### Genome sequence
